# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis

This machine learning project by **Anjali Sharma** analyzes retail sales data to uncover insights and build predictive models for future sales forecasting. The dataset includes store-level features, sales, and metadata.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `notebooks/` – Contains the main Jupyter notebook for data exploration and model building.
- `data/` – Raw data files: features, stores, and sales.

## 📊 Datasets

- `features.csv.xls` – Store-level features (temperature, CPI, etc.).
- `stores.csv.xls` – Metadata for each store.
- `train.csv.xls` – Weekly sales data per store and department.

## 🧠 Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict weekly sales based on historical and store-level data.
